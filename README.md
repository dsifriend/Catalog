# A Catalog

This program was written with the intention of making use of _Pandoc_ to convert
a very simple custom text format for cataloging things into standardized
documents, as well as providing facilities to manage said catalog (e.g. search
and sort functions).

## Features
### Implemented:
  - Basic text import
  - Basic pandoc output

### Planned:
 1. Sorting
 2. Fuzzy Search
 3. Commandline options via `Text.Pandoc.App`
 4. Specialized template for PDF export

### Not Planned:
  - Live data entry. (The format was designed to be simple for a reason.)
  - Complete support for all pandoc formats. (Not all are as versatile.)
